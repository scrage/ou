# Creating/referencing bibliographic resources
Use the following template to create and keep track of resource references:
> CiteKey: (a unique identifier (or primary key) for the entry)
>
>Title: (the title of the work)
>
>Author(s): (the author(s) of the work, presented if necessary as a list)
>
>Format: (the type of resource, i.e. whether a journal, magazine, technical report, commercial white paper, web page, personal communication, etc)
>
>Publisher: (the publisher of the resource)
>
>Year: (the year the resource was published or the year it was last checked)
>
>Pages: (the page numbers, if applicable)
>
>URL and last accessed: (the web location where the resource was found, and the date on which you last accessed it)
>
>Referenced by: (which other item(s) in your BDMS (if any) suggested this information resource)
>
>Abstract: (a copy of the abstract for the resource, should one exist)
>
>Notes: (the notes that you have made on the resource)

**Example:**
> CiteKey: Keshav2007How
>
>Title: How to read a paper
>
>Author(s): S. Keshav (keshav@uwaterloo.ca)
>
>Format: Academic paper

>
>Year: 2007
>
>Pages: 83–84

>URL and last accessed: [http://dl.acm.org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/ citation.cfm?doid=1273445.1273458](http://dl.acm.org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/citation.cfm?doid=1273445.1273458) Last accessed: 19 November 2013.

And since this is an online material, the version should be properly referenced as well. In a OU Harvard style the full reference would be:

Keshav, S. (2007) ‘How to read a paper’, _ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review_, vol. 37, no. 3 \[Online\]. Available at http://dl.acm.org.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/citation.cfm?doid=1273445.1273458 (accessed 19 November 2013).


# Assimilating an academic article
We almost never have the whole time needed to assimilate an article at once. There are ways to record our understanding of a paper from one reading to the next.

## Annotiation
Example annotations on Keshav's paper (in red, electronic highlights in yellow), via Open University:
![Described image](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/3217611/mod_oucontent/oucontent/1277084/0d216393/076fc932/m811_res1_fig02.eps.jpg)
_(OU's annotation of Keshav’s article (Keshav, 2007)_

### Kershav's first pass
1.  Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction
2.  Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else
3.  Read the conclusions
4.  Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read.

At the end of the first pass, the reader should be able to answer 'the five Cs':
-   _Category_: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
-   _Context_: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyse the problem?
-   _Correctness_: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
-   _Contributions_: What are the paper’s main contributions?
-   _Clarity_: Is the paper well written?

### Kershav's second pass
Spend about 1 hour on the paper and try to reach a point where you are able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else; to become able to reconstruct the reasoning that the paper uses in its contribution to knowledge or practice.
Ignore any highly technical details such as proofs, implementations or detailed justification of any argument.

### Kershav's third pass
Not all papers require a third pass and you should take care in deciding whether a particular paper should have one.
The third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper; to make the same assumptions as the authors, to recreate their work.
