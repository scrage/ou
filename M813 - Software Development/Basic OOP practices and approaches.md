# A general point to make about programming paradigms

First of all, there is an argument about programming paradigms in general, which puts the reson for having distinguishable programming approaches into the limelight, and resolves some debates about about them -- or even makes these debates straight invalid:
> "All programming paradigms assisst developers to adopt programming habits that constrain them **to help them to limit mistakes**."

Every programming paradigm, one way or another, essentially try to limit the programmer who adpts it, and that self-imposed limitation helps the programmer to steer away from potential mistakes.
And they tend to guard us from more mistakes than that of the freedom we have to give up for them.

**Structural programming** ensures a straight-forward execution flow by constraining the flow of transfer of control. (**Esgar Dijkstra** considered GOTO harmful. --  ***Structured Programming, 1968***)

**Functional programming** constrains assignment by writing code with no side-effects (relying on *immutability*): Each function translates its inputs into a new output, without changing those inputs in any way at all. (This is also referred to as *pure functioning programming*.)

**Logic programming** constrains programs to follow rules of formal logic.

One could even argue that **Machine Learning programming** constrains programming to specifications of fitness functions and selection of training data.

**OO programming** aims to put constrains on dependency management through polymorphism, as described by **Robert C. Martin**.

### A general good advice
Adopt programming habits that constrain you, to help you limit mistakes. Any programming paradigm only assists with that.

This choice of programming paradigm is truly just a choice, and it *can be fluid and contextual*. We can write crap code with any paradigm just as we can write great code with any paradigm as well. There is no bad or good paradigm, the existence of this debate is superfluous to say the least.

# OOP Programming

## The real value of OO is not the objects and inheritance, but messaging and polymorphism!
Object-Orientation is not merely about inheritance or polymorphism, as many OO developers tend to think. Alan Kay, who invented the term object-orient programming (***Object Orientation, 1966***) later said:
> "I'm sorry that I, long ago, coined the term "Objects" for this topic, because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is messaging!"

He presumably meant that the key value of OO is the phenomena where we can send a message to **something** (a.k.a. an object) and it figures out how to process that **message**.
We can send the same message to 2 different objects and each of them (could) deal with that same message different ways -- ways that makes sense to them.

And this is polymorphism. The true value of OO is polymorphism, not inheritance.
In fact, the 1972 version of SmallTalk didn't even support inheritance at all.

## Visibility
**Encapsulation** is the discipline of organising an objectâ€™s properties and operations into private and public areas, depending on whether other objects should be able to access them. By defining what parts of a class in code should be private, public, or other, we declare their **visibility**.
Some languages, like Java, lets us control access to classes, methods, and operations via **access modifiers**.

## Classes and interfaces
Most object-oriented languages provide constructs to define classes and interfaces. Make sure to make use of abstract classes for implementing generalisation and hierarchies, and represent abilities or contracts as interfaces.

## Generalisation and realisation
Generalisation means inheritance between classes, realisation means implementing interfaces.

## Attributes
Attributes are generally realised as variables within a class declaration, and different languages can have it slightly different ways (e.g Java offers fields for private attributes and getter/setter methods for public access, while C# - on top of field variables - has properties, which can constrain visibility any way we want to).

From a certain perspective variables can be of two types:
- **instance variables**, corresponding to object (instance) attributes
- **class variables**, corresponding to class attributes (having them shared among all the class instances, or existing as a static way).

## Operations
In oo languages operations are implemented as **methods**. Similarly to attributes, methods can be either instance or class methods (in the latter case, they are sometimes also referred to as functions).
- **Instance methods** correspond to object operations and are invoked on objects.
- **Class methods** correspond to class operations and are invoked on the class itself.

## Constructors
Constructors are a special category of methods, responsible for creating new class instances (given that the class is neither abstract nor static). Usually an oo language has a default parameterless constructor for every instantiable class.

## Encapsulation via getters, setters and properties (Java and C#)
Control data visibility within classes by using getters and setters in Java, and properties in C#.
