# Reflective thinking, reflective learning and academic writing
## Reflection
The _process_ of reflectiontypically involve:
 - thinking with a purpose
 - introspection (looking within oneself, examining one's conscious thoughts and feelings)
 - questioning and probing
 - evaluating prior knowledge, beliefs, assumptions or learned experience
 - making judgements and drawing conclusions.

It can also be defined by consciously thinking about and analysing:
- what you are currently doing
- what you have previously done
- what you have experienced
- what and how you have learned.

At its core, "reflective thinking" is the notion of awareness of one's own knowledge, assumptions, and past experiences.
Your past experience and learning provide the context of your thoughts, and therefore unique to you. Reflective thinking is a dynamic process that continues to develop and evolve as you learn and respond to new experiences, check that make "sense" to you, creating meaning, justify actions and solve problems, and it helps with your future planning.

Reflective thinking explores different reasons for, considers the potential implications of, and is influenced by an individual's attitudes or practices. It is the process that allows you to make meaning of an experience; involves analytic and critiquing elements; can be articulatedthrough spoken or written forms of expression.

**Reflection** is one of the key elements of **Personal Development Planning** (PDP).


## Learning Journals
- Update the learning journal regularly, even if individual entries are sometimes short.
- Focus on s specific activity, issue or a topic for an individual entry -- think about how you could address or resolve the issue, or what you'd like to improve (e.g. understanding of a concept).
- Use questions or prompts to help you focus on the task.
- Avoid descriptive writing -- take an analytical approach.
- Review your entries, identify themes and recognize the longer-term action you might need to take (e.g. improve a particular study style).

You can use writing to explore ideas as a way of understanding them.

A group of entry in the learning journal should always include these questions/prompts:
- Description of events [Experience] -- what?
- Unpicking the events [Reflection] -- so what?
- What has been learned, what is the impact of learning? [Learning] -- now what?

Other entries can be added according to relevance:
- purpose
- outcome
- focus
- method
- theory
- audience
- etc.

_Example:_

| Entry category | Description |
| - | - |
| The situation - what happened; how did I think, feel and act? | I meant to start work on my TMA02 today but kept finding other things to do. After 2 hours, I still had not written anything. |
| Why might thinds have happened that way? | When I thought about it, I realized I was worried about whether my tutor would see any improvements on my first TMA. I really want to show I'm taking her feedback on board. |
| What might I have done differently? What should I try next time? | I could have thought about my tutor's positive comments. I could be more determined to use my study time as I plan to. |

-   Think back over your learning and experience.
-   Understand these at a deeper level.
-   Use that understanding to do things differently in the future, to effect change through learning.


## Academic writing - general principles
Academic writing is more formal than reflective writing and requires a specific set of skills.
-   Work needs to be grounded and supported by appropriate (informed and credible) sources.
-   The language used is more tentative or cautious (fewer ‘absolute’ statements).
-   Colloquial terms and contractions (don’t, won’t, shouldn’t, etc.) are avoided.
-   Ideas from others need to be attributed accurately (cited and referenced appropriately).
-   Writing needs to be structured logically, with clear expression of thought.
-   It needs to show a deeper, more critical engagement with the subject matter.
-   There should be clear evidence of your extended reading and understanding of the topic.
-   Writing at the very highest level, approaches the style you would read in a scholarly publication, such as an academic journal.

Following this seven-point procedure for writing assignments (adapted from Cottrell, 2013) is highly advised:

1.  **Clarify the task**: Examine the assignment brief carefully and determine the exact requirements. Pay particular attention to any guidance notes.
2.  **Collect and record information**: Be selective and use your judgement when gathering information. Check word limits.
3.  **Organise and plan**: Careful planning helps prevent repetition, clarifies your thinking, and helps you organise the material.
4.  **Engage, reflect, evaluate**: Is it clear to you why this task was set? Do you have enough evidence and examples? Has your viewpoint changed? What arguments or evidence oppose your point of view? Are they valid? Have you clarified your argument?
5.  **Write an outline plan and first draft**: Structure your writing, include section headings. Work out the order to introduce each point.
6.  **Work on your initial drafts**: Develop and improve your first draft. Make sure your argument is clear to the reader. Check that you have included examples and evidence to support your points. Check that you have cited and referenced every source of information you have used. Check your work against specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria and make sure you have met these. Rewrite your early drafts – _leave time between these to allow you to further hone, develop and fine-tune your thoughts!_
7.  **Prepare your final draft**: Edit, check and proofread your final draft. Correct errors and improve the flow of writing. Read it out loud to check that your writing is clear.

For essay writing, Prof. Jordan Peterson's [Essay Writing Guide](https://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx) is a valuable template to use - it also introduces one to correct habbits for producing an essay.


## Academic writing
Good academic writing can be summed up by the 'STAR' principle:
- **S**tructure
- **T**one
- **A**udience
- **R**elevance

**Target audience** plays an important role in determining the type of written work and its content and style. Start with setting this first.

General guidelines for writing:
- Be concise and clear
- Be your own text editor - revise drafts regularly, edit carefully
- Support your arguments
- Avoid plagiarism
- Use paragraphs and signposting (headings, sub-headings)
- Develop a sense of your audience
- Keep sentences short

General guidelines for presenting written work:
- Use a consistent style
- Use appropriate spacing
- Use logical page endings
- Include headings for all tables, and captions for all figures
- Check and recheck your work
- Clarity is essential

Guidelines for writing at postgraduate level:
- Avoid contractions and slang terms.
- Use specific terminology where necessart, but define key terms.
- Use a style that suits your purpose and the target audience.
- Include only ideas that are relevant to your argument and topic.
- Keep the style of your writing style simple and clear.
- Present ideas in logical order.
- Be cautious in your writing.
- Use clear, precise language; avoid emotive language.
- Provide signposts, transition words, and summaries to help the reader.
- Use subheadings and sections where appropriate.
- Cite relevant sources.
- Explain, not just describe.
- Use quotes and examples as required.
- Make sure that you establish clear connections between ideas.

# Critical and analytical thinking
[An interesting blog post on critical thinking](https://theconversation.com/lets-stop-trying-to-teach-students-critical-thinking-30321)

Human thinking pervades every aspect of life and every dimension of the human mind.
Though it is human nature to think, it is not natural for humans to think well (human nature is heavily influenced by prejudice, illusion, mythology, ignorance and self-deception).
Therefore, we need to be able to intervene in thinking, to analyse, assess it, and where necessary, improve it.

People who are better critical thinkers have the capacity to present alternative and opposing viewpoints in a coherent manner to provide understanding and new insights (_intellectual empathy_), distinguish what they know from what they do not know and are prepared to examine new evidence and arguments even if such examination leads to the discovery of flaws in their own beliefs (_intellectual humility_), think for themselves while adhering to rigorous standards for thought (_intellectual autonomy_), and are open to critique and can be moved by reasoning that is better than their own (_confidence in reason_).

## Fundamental aspects of critical thinking
**Abilities:**
-   analysing arguments, claims or evidence
-   judging or evaluating based on evidence
-   making inferences using inductive or deductive reasoning
-   making decisions and/or solving problems through reasoning.

**Dispositions:**
-   open-mindedness
-   searcher of truth
-   inquisition
-   fair and balanced view of one’s work and that of others.

| Domain | Description | Keywords |
| - | - | - |
| **Knowledge** | Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling information, fundamental facts and terms, as well as discovery, through observing and locating. | Who? What? Find Define Recall |
| **Comprehension** | Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organising, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptors and stating main ideas. | Compare Contrast Explain Discuss |
| **Application** | Solve problems in new situations by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules in a different or new way. | Plan Build Experiment Design Solve Interview |
| **Analysis** | Examine and break information into parts by identifying motives or causes. Make inferences and find evidence to support generalisations. | Dissect Examine Infer Compare Contrast |
| **Synthesis** | Compile information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions. | Compose Construct Create Design Develop Theorise Elaborate Formulate |
| **Evaluation** | This is also denoted as ‘critical evaluation’, often used to emphasise the depth of evaluation required. You will be required to present and defend opinions by making judgements about information, the validity of ideas or quality of work based on a set of criteria. | Compare Justify Prove Disprove Deduct |

## How to evaluate an argument
An argument is an action or process of reasoning systematically in support of an idea, action, or theory.
In order to evaluate academic or any other material, you are aiming t oform a judgement on the validity of the argument presented.

In this context, an argument can be said to have four basic components:
- an arguable premise or claim
- use of facts and evidence
- a warrant
- any qualifications to the argument that might be necessary.

**The claim**: The point that is being made; what is being argued for.
**The evidence**: The ground upon which the claim is made.
**The warrant**: The general principle that forms the bridge between the claim and the evidence it is based on. It is the logical reasoning that connects the evidence to the claim. It moves from step to step in a clear, developmental manner.
**Qualifications**: Concessions that may have to be made within an argument that limit what someone might be able to claim.

### Example
Let’s consider the following argument:

> Statistics from a number of higher education institutions suggest that students who attend tutorials often pass their examinations. In 2014, 58% of students surveyed indicated that they believe their attendance at tutorials was the main reason for their success in their examination. I am a very motivated student who is very keen to pass my examinations so I will attend all my tutorials and feel confident it will guarantee my success.

The claim here is that attending tutorials will somehow guarantee success in examination. Remember we are not saying this is true or false. What we are doing is evaluating the _claim_ being made. Firstly, according to the author, there is some evidence (58% of students from a survey) to suggest that students who attend tutorials often pass their examinations. However, the survey data does not indicate the sample size or population, and the source of the data has not been referenced, so there is no opportunity to refer back to the original source. This is important because the sample size may not be compelling. Also the population chosen for the study may reveal certain characteristics that could influence our judgement about the claim being made. The survey response, as reported in this extract, also indicates that attendance at tutorials was the main reason (for student’s success in exams), which implies that there were other factors, too. This makes the argument imbalanced because it hasn’t adequately explored other reasons for the association between success and attending tutorials. The writer qualifies their argument by including motivation as another factor and, by doing so (indirectly), acknowledges the limitations of over-reliance on attendance at tutorials as a reason for success.

In summary, the claim is attempting to establish a ‘cause and effect’ without providing compelling evidence. Perhaps, attending tutorials could be a contributory factor if we considered this within a spectrum of factors that could help students to succeed at examinations. The example provided here therefore represents a ‘flawed’ argument.

In order to think about this argument _critically_, you would ask the following questions:

-   Who was surveyed and what was the sample size?
-   What are the characteristics of students who attend tutorials? For example, do they have more time to study and is this the factor that gives them the edge?
-   What is it about tutorials that may make a difference?
-   What else contributes to success?

## Evaluating an argument – coherence and supporting evidence
When evaluating written material, we are aiming to form a judgement on the validity of the argument presented. We can do this by looking at (i) the coherence of the argument, and (ii) the supporting evidence.
-   **Coherence of the argument:** identify when an argument is valid (i.e. that claims made adequately support the conclusions being drawn, and are justifiable).
-   **Supporting evidence:** evaluate the evidence being presented, and to establish its worth (in its own right, and when compared with other evidence).


# Critical reading and writing
Before even evaluating a material:
1. Identify the thrist of the information
2. Analyse the material
3. Compare and apply the information

**Identify the thrust of the information**: identify the general thrust of the argument within the information you are reading. Simply try to define and be aware of the subject matter. Try to identify the main points of the argument, the claims to be made, evidence used, conclusions reached.

**Analyse the material**: think about whether or not the material is relevant to your needs.
-   Does the information make sense in relation to other theories and research? Where in the broader picture does this particular argument sit?
-   How old is the material?
-   Is the material clear, or do you need to find additional information to aid your understanding?
-   Can you identify any implications that might require you to look for other material? (Perhaps complementary explanations of a phenomenon if the original material is not comprehensive enough.)
-   Does the argument present a balanced view, or is the author disregarding some topics in order to put forward a particular argument?

**Compare and apply information**: In order to try to apply theories, principles or formulae situations, try looking for the following:
-   The implications of one piece of information for another.
-   Weaknesses that might be revealed when you apply the idea to a real-life situation.
-   A lack of coverage. Does the theory or formula only go so far, and do you need to rely upon another theory or principle to complete your understanding?

## A process for reading and selecting relevant material
Having very limited time, you will have to be selective and economical with your reading, but critical, too. When encountering a reading material for an assignment, keep in mind the following points:
- Overview of the contents
- Relation to the assignment question
- How you intend to draw on the material

![Described image](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/756269/mod_oucontent/oucontent/37791/a0b0239f/524e2b62/wk4_figure01.png) _(Source: Open University)_

## Critical writing
You must be able to express your ideas in a critical way, which means demonstrating your understanding of the significance of an argument or perspecitve, the relevance of evidence and the strength of conclusions made.
Your writing need to show evidence of your ability to defend an argument against charges such as bias, lack of supporting evidence or incompleteness.


## Focusing on answering questions correctly
-   **Evaluate, assess, defend, support:** you will need to prepare a reasoned judgement based on your analysis.
-   **Apply, demonstrate, illustrate, interpret, solve:** you will need to apply the subject (to a given situation).
-   **Develop, formulate, arrange:** you are expected to combine the material with other materials you read in the course.
-   **Compare, contrast, discriminate, distinguish, examine:** you will need to analyse the argument.
-   **Define, list, name, order:** you will need to identify the content.

## The difference between descriptive and critical/analytical writing
Descriptive Writing | Critical/analytical writing
- | -
States what happened | Identifies the significance
States what something is like | Evaluates (judges the value of) strengths and weaknesses
Gives the story so far | Weighs one piece of information against another
States the order in which things happened | Makes reasoned judgements
Says how to do something | Argues a case according to evidence
Explains what a theory says | Shows why something is relevant or suitable
Explains how something works | Indicates why something will work (best)
Notes the method used | Indicates whether something is appropriate or suitable
Says when something occurred | Identifies why the timing is important
States the different components | Weighs up the importance of component parts
States options | Gives reason for the selection of each option
Lists details  | Evaluates the relative significance of details
Lists in any order | Structures information in order (e.g. of importance)
States links between items | Shows the relevance of links between pieces of information
Gives information | Draws conclusions
(Adapted from Cottrell, 1999)

## Using structuring devices
In addition to structuring your writing, you also must convey the overall logic and progression of your argument, as this demonstrates critical thinking.
Some suggestions:
- Use context and examples
- Use themes
- Link and signpost

### Context and examples
Define the background of the subject for the reader, and contextualise at different points of the argument if needed, in order to introduce perspectives.
Moving from a broad argument to a particular example helps to support the overarching argument.

### Themes
Your assignment question (or the notes that accompany it) may reference certain themes explicitly or implicitly. Draw on themes to add structure to your writing, as they can prove a useful device that might help you link different aspects of your course learning. Use them to demonstrate differences and similarities between schools of thought or theoretical approaches. You can also use a theme to help you to frame an argument or conclusion.

### Link and signpost
Use linking words and signposting to connect your ideas. These make clear to the reader both how your argument progresses logically from one point to the next, and how each new point is relevant.
Some examples:
-   **Draw attention to certain points:** ‘equally importantly’, ‘furthermore’.
-   **Indicate cause and effect progression**: ‘this results in’, ‘consequently’, ‘for this reason’.
-   **Indicate progression within an argument:** ‘therefore’, ‘however’, ‘nevertheless’.

# Searching for, evaluating and keeping up-to-date with information

## Digital and information literacy
**Information literacy** (IL) is the ability to recognise when information is needed; know how to locate and evaluate the appropriateness of information found; know how to use this in an effective and responsible manner. 

> **Information literacy** is knowing when and why you need information, where to find it, and how to evaluate, use and communicate it in an ethical manner.
_(CILIP, 2004)_


> **Digital literacy** includes the ability to find and use information (otherwise known as information literacy) but goes beyond this to encompass communication, collaboration and teamwork, social awareness in the digital environment, understanding of e-safety and creation of new information. Both digital and information literacy are underpinned by critical thinking and evaluation.
_(OU Library, 2014)_

## Recognising different types of information

At the simplest level, sources of information can be categorised into four main groups:
-   **Primary literature** describes mainly new or ‘original’ material (e.g. a research paper published in peer-reviewed journals, or a patent). -- Often written by specialists for specialists.
-   **Secondary literature** refers to material in which information that has appeared in another form is repackaged and disseminated more widely (e.g. review articles, academic textbooks and course materials). -- Useful in helping you to engage with a new research area. It is generally easier to read than a primary research paper, but harder to evaluate in terms of authenticity and potential bias.
-   **Grey literature** is defined as ‘articles and information published, especially on the Internet, without a commercial purpose or the mediation of a commercial publisher’ (_Dictionary of Information and Library Management_, 2006). These include technical reports, government documents, working group documents etc.
-   **Personal communication** is a potential source of information, often overlooked but becoming increasingly prevalent with the rise of social networking and online feeds (e.g. information from a colleague or expert opinion; online communication in a social networking site such as Twitter or Facebook; contributions to your own or other individual researchers, or group blogs and wikis).

## Evaluating information using the 'PROMPT' criteria
Use this criteria to assess the credibility and potential value of any resource:
Criteria | Description
-|-
**Provenance** | Is it clear where the information has come from? Can you identify the author(s)/organisation(s)? Are there references/citations that lead to further reading? Are they credible sources in your view? Can the author or source of the information be considered a reliable authority on the subject?
**Relevance** | Is the information you have found relevant to the topic you are researching? Does it meet your specific requirements? Does it make sense in the particular context in which you are working?
**Objectivity** | Does the author or owner of the information make clear their own and/or alternative views? Is the article biased, or motivated by a particular agenda? Is the language emotive? Are there hidden, vested interests?
**Method** | Is it clear how the work was carried out? Were the methods appropriate? Do they permit the author to come to a sound and reasonable conclusion?
**Presentation** | Is the information presented and communicated clearly? Consider the language, layout and structure. Is the information clearly laid out and easy to navigate?
**Timeliness** | How up-to-date is the material? Is it clear when it was written? Is it recent or dated? Does the age of the information matter – does it still meet your requirements, or would it be considered ‘obsolete’ for your purposes (i.e. for a specific assignment)?

## Keeping up-to-date with information - deciding which tool to use
In deciding which tool to use, think about these questions:

<table><tr><th scope\="col">Tool</th><th scope\="col">Pros</th><th scope\="col">Cons</th></tr><tr><td><b>Mailing lists</b></td><td><ul class\="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Archived on the web</li><li>Opportunity for networking</li></ul></td><td><ul class\="oucontent-bulleted"><li>May overwhelm your mailbox</li><li>Limited audience</li><li>Not always active</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>RSS Feeds</b></td><td><ul class\="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Updated frequently</li><li>Able to access full information (e.g. article, podcast or proceedings) from brief summary</li><li>Easy to manage</li></ul></td><td><ul class\="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Need to set up a feed reader</li><li>Graphics and photos do not appear</li><li>Not always available</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>Alerts</b></td><td><ul class\="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Delivered to your mailbox</li><li>Relevance is high</li><li>Exposed to material you were unaware of</li></ul></td><td><ul class\="oucontent-bulleted"><li>Dependent on the quality of your search</li><li>Have to register with several sites</li><li>Not available for every resource you may be interested in</li></ul></td></tr></table>

## Citing and referring to sources
It is a standard requirement for academic and professional practice to openly acknowledge the words, thoughts and ideas of others, and not to present them as if they were your own.
Failure to reference appropriately is considered poor academic practice, and could be further construed as an attempt to ‘deceive’ the reader regarding the originality and authenticity of your work (whether intentionally or unintended), which would be regarded as plagiarism.

### Referencing systems
-   **Alphabetic referencing** is where the author’s surname and date of publication are listed in the in-text citation, while the final reference list is sorted alphabetically. The most commonly used example is the Harvard referencing system.
-   **Numeric referencing** is where the sources used are allocated a number based on the order of their first occurrence in the text, with this number listed in the in-text citation, while the final reference list is ordered numerically, comprising of the author’s name, year of publication and other reference details. The most commonly used example is the Vancouver referencing system.

[OU Harvard guide to citing references](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/mod/oucontent/olink.php?id=64085&targetdoc=OU+Harvard+guide+to+citing+references)

### Secondary (indirect) references
A secondary (or indirect) reference is when you have not read the original piece of work, but are citing what the author of the article you have read has said about this other author’s work.

In such cases, you need to make it clear you have not consulted the secondary reference, but are citing this from the context of the primary reference you have read. For example:

‘According to Rüggeberg et al., as cited by Knudson et al. (2010), …’

or

‘As noted in Knudson et al. (2010), Rüggeberg et al. showed that…’

By using phrases such as ‘as cited by’ and ‘as noted in’, you are clearly indicating that you have not read the work by Rüggeberg et al., but are referring to the interpretation of this work by Knudson et al. As the paper by Rüggeberg et al. is a secondary reference, it should not be included in your final reference list. Your final reference list should only contain resources you have read (i.e. your primary references). Given the potential for misinterpretation and/or misrepresentation of another author’s work, you should use secondary references sparingly and avoid them if possible. If you do need to use a secondary reference, make this very clear in your text.

## Digital object identifiers (DOIs)
Recently published journal article will have a digital object identifier or ‘DOI’ reference associated with the article (often on the front page). These typically take the format ‘doi:10.1016/…’.
You can convert the DOI reference into an active URL by listing ‘http://dx.doi.org/’ in front of the number (e.g. [http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1016/ j.sbspro.2016.07.086](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.07.086 "The Open University is not responsible for external site content") ).

## Developing a selective and critical reading skill
When selecting materials, consider the following points:
- **Is it worth reading?**
- **Skim-read the article to identify the important parts that need detailed analysis**.
- **Decide which key points you want to extract from the article that are relevant to your studies**.
- **Look out for ‘pointers’ or ‘keywords’ in the text that alert you to ask critical questions**.
‘However’ may introduce an opposing view or contradictory evidence. Can you identify any author bias? ‘Although’ is a qualifying word. Is the evidence reliable? Does it really support the argument? ‘Therefore/so’ can be used to draw together the argument when making a concluding statement. Is the conclusion logical? Is the reasoning justified? ‘Probably/possibly’ may be introducing an unsubstantiated generalisation. ‘Generally/most/many/some’ and ‘may/appears/seem to’ are qualifying words which allow for exceptions to a statement. Does this weaken the argument?
- **Ensure that you make a note of relevant bibliographic details** (e.g. author, title, journal, volume, year, page numbers, DOI or URL etc.).

# Reflective writing, reflective practice and discipline perspectives
## Reflective practice
Reflective practice:
-   anchors theory in meaningful, concrete experience
-   gives recognition to learning gained in non-academic contexts
-   provides a bridge between practical experience and academic study
-   helps develop understanding of difficult work situations, improving professional practice
_(Cottrell, 2011)_

Reflecting on your successes is a basis for successful practice, while reflecting on mistakes or problems can help you avoid repeating them or help to find an appropriate solution. This forms the basis of personal and professional development planning. Reflective writing is explorative in nature; it includes description (What? When? Who?), and analysis (How? Why? What if?), and can also result in more questions than answers.

Words and phrases that might be useful for reflective writing:
### Interpretation and analysis
![Described image](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/788970/mod_oucontent/oucontent/39534/db9aa7a2/6a648914/wk7_figure02.jpg)
_(Reflective writing: interpretation and analysis (Syed, Scoular and Reaney, 2012))_

### Outcome and synthesis

_(Reflective writing: outcome and synthesis (Syed, Scoular and Reaney, 2012))_

## Some important points to consider
#### Be selective in your writing
Adopt a critical stance and be honest about your experiences. There is always an element of looking ahead, based on reflection of what has been experienced, so the outcomes resulting from your critical reflection need to be clear, and you should specify what you may do differently next time.
#### Use the right language and an appropriate writing style
It should always be clear to the reader when a claim is your view, and when you are expressing views and claims by others.
####Self-reflection
#### Use reflective writing in professional subject areas

### Tips for successful reflective writing (adapted from Syed, Scoular and Reaney, 2012)
-   use full sentences and complete paragraphs
-   you can use personal pronouns (‘I’, ‘my’, ‘we’)
-   avoid colloquial language
-   keep your writing concise, presentable and legible
-   be honest in your self-assessment
-   ensure the content is clear and shows good observation in presenting the learning event and any associated issues.

Your reflective account should also:

-   show depth and detail (a deeper approach to subject matter)
-   be thorough, demonstrate self-awareness, and show a willingness to revise your ideas
-   show evidence of critical and creative thinking
-   represent different cognitive skills (synthesis, analysis, evaluation)
-   include a statement of learning needs, linked to your personal development planning
-   propose clear action(s) in response to the reflection
-   note the questions that arise from the reflective process (and on which to reflect further).

## Examples of good and poor critical reflection

<table><tbody><tr><th>Aspect</th><th >Good critical reflection</th><th >Poor critical reflection</th></tr><tr><td><b>Experience</b></td><td>Draws on personal, group or workplace experience as a means of testing out theory or new learning; looking at experiences with a ‘critical eye’.</td><td>Assumes ‘experience’ is an end in itself; that one’s own experience is typical of others’ without good evidence that this is so; that experience automatically equates to ‘insight’ without critical thought.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Personal Responsibility</b></td><td>Demonstrates integrity both in focusing on one’s personal role, such as the assumptions brought to a situation or actions taken or omitted, and in taking responsibility for the consequences of these.</td><td>Finds ways of reflecting blame on to other people or the context itself for the way events unfolded; alternatively, personal responsibility is addressed in a superficial way, so that the relation of action and consequence is not considered in depth.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Focus</b></td><td>Selects a focus, such as a particular time period, set of events, specific kinds of incident or examples of interactions.</td><td>Is non-specific or covers too many dimensions, so the focus of the reflection is not clear.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Scale</b></td><td>The focus is broad enough to offer challenge and meaningful insights, but can be reasonably explored in the timescale and any word limits.</td><td>Is either too narrow to provide the insights needed or too broad to look at issues in any depth.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Direction</b></td><td>Begins to take direction as one starts to identify, and then focus on, selected themes for closer attention. </td><td>Wanders or jumps about rather than finds a direction.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Depth</b></td><td>Delves below the surface: it picks up on initial thoughts and insights, analysing these further with the aim of gaining deeper insights or broader applications.</td><td>Is superficial and does not demonstrate any interest in burrowing beneath the surface to understand more.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Challenge</b></td><td>Usually tackles a difficult area or enters difficult terrain, such as matters that are personally difficult, or issues that are complex and do not lend themselves to easy answers.</td><td>Tends to stay within ‘safe territory’, or deals with difficult issues in a superficial way, or does not seem to take the person forward in their understanding.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Theory</b></td><td>Draws on relevant theoretical standpoints, research, or established professional practice in ways that demonstrate how these have helped understanding; where relevant, it relates the particular incident to broader social and political issues.</td><td>Draws only on the person’s own ideas, experiences and anecdotes, or makes superficial passing references to theory and research.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Criticality</b></td><td>Brings a searching critical eye to the focus of the reflection, to emerging insights, and to any theories or sources of information. This criticality is used to take the person forward in their understanding of the core emerging issues by, for example, challenging their own ideas and actions, or showing how their experience supports or challenges existing knowledge.</td><td>Is preoccupied mainly with describing situations, content or events. May include critical analysis but this does not seem to be used in a way that really develops an understanding of the core emerging issues.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Insight</b></td><td>The reflection takes the person forward in their understanding, such that they can make more sense of their situation, work or study, manage better within it, do things differently, apply understanding to new contexts etc.</td><td>The reflection gives little indication that the person has moved forward in their understanding of the context or issue, or self-knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td><b>End-points</b> (extrapolated conclusions)</td><td>The process of reflection may take the person in many different directions. However, by the end, they have stood back, drawn out the key messages of what they have learnt and summarised these as conclusions or recommendations.</td><td>The reflection reads more as a description of a process or rambling free association. The lessons learned are not drawn out clearly as conclusions or recommendations. </td></tr><tr id="yui_3_17_2_1_1617183847760_36"><td><p><b>Audience </b></p><p>(if reflection is to be shared)</p></td><td id="yui_3_17_2_1_1617183847760_35">If this is to be used in academic, work or public contexts, the writing up of reflection demonstrates a sound understanding of ethical considerations and stylistic or academic conventions that may apply, and any issues of confidentiality will have been addressed appropriately.</td><td>The reflection is submitted or made public without all due care being taken to ensure that confidentiality and other data protection issues are addressed; no thought is given to how to make the reflection manageable for others to read.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Applying critical thinking skills

![Described image](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/799182/mod_oucontent/oucontent/40533/a0b0239f/b61971d5/160703_critical_and_analytic_thinking_colour_v0.jpg)

[Higher definition version](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/ocw/pluginfile.php/918927/mod_resource/content/1/Critical%20and%20analytical%20thinking.pdf)

## Common pitfalls and barriers to critical thinking
-   **Misunderstanding**. This can arise due to language or cultural differences, a lack of awareness of the ‘processes’ involved, or a misunderstanding that critical thinking means making ‘negative’ comments.
-   **Reluctance to critique** the ‘norm’ or experts in a field and consider alternative views (feeling out of your ‘comfort zone’ or fearful of being wrong).
-   **Lack of detailed knowledge**. Superficial knowledge (not having read deeply enough around the subject).
-   **Wanting to know the answers without having to ask questions**.

Critical thinking encourages you to be constructive, by considering the strengths and weaknesses of a claim and differing sides to an argument. It helps you to clarify points, encourages deeper thought, and allows you to determine whether information that you come across is accurate and reliable. This helps you to form your own judgement, and drives research forward.

Critical and reflective thinking are complex and lifelong skills that you continue to develop as part of your personal and professional growth. In your everyday life, you may also come across those who do not exercise critical thinking, and this might impact on decisions that affect you. It is important to recognise this, and to use critical and reflective thinking to ensure that your own view is informed by reasoned judgement, supported by evidence.

At a personal level, based on a person's disposition, barriers to critical thinking can arise through:
-   an over-reliance on feelings or emotions
-   self-centred or societal/cultural-centred thinking (conformism, dogma and peer-pressure)
-   unconscious bias, or selective perception
-   an inability to be receptive to an idea or point of view that differs from your own (close-mindedness)
-   unwarranted assumptions or lack of relevant information
-   fear of being wrong (anxious about being taken out of your ‘comfort zone’)
-   poor communication skills or apathy
-   lack of personal honesty.

Be aware that thinking critically is not simply adhering to a formula. For example, reflect on the following questions:

-   How can you communicate with those who do not actively engage with critical thinking and are unwilling to engage in a meaningful dialogue?
-   How would you react or respond when you experience a lack of critical thinking in the media, amongst your own family members, colleagues at work, or on your course?

Don't fall into the pit of arrogance.

## Showing evidence of your ability to think critically
**When reading critically**, before delving into the detail, make sure you have a clear grasp of the basics first. Read the Conclusions, and the first and last passages of the Introduction, Discussion or Abstract of an article to get an overview of the arguments. Look out for recommendations, critiques or challenges put forward by the author, and for evidence supporting their argument. Is it credible? Is it biased? Does it serve its purpose? Does it advance knowledge or understanding? Are there any flaws?

**When writing critically**, you must support all of your ideas with evidence, and explain (communicate) your reasoning clearly. To do this you will need to research and read widely around a topic (provide context), plan your argument and select relevant supporting evidence. Consider alternative perspectives, theories and evidence, develop your ideas, explore relationships and links, and question your own assumptions as much as those of other authors. Why is it that you agree or disagree with a particular view? Does the argument match with what you know about the subject already? Does it fit with what others have said? Is it relevant and useful to your purpose? How does it add value to previous work in the area? Use tentative language in academic writing (unless your assignment requires you to do otherwise), and make sure that you don’t generalise from a single study.

## How to write postgraduate assignments
Assessors and examiners will be looking for evidence that you:

-   are not simply taking everything that you read (e.g. claims being made) as ‘granted’
-   are exerting independent thought and originality of thought in researching a particular subject (insight and thoughtful engagement with the subject)
-   have read widely around the subject, display an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the issues (demonstrating scholarship)
-   can demonstrate that you are able to distinguish and critically evaluate different types of information (data/theories/evidence/results) as appropriate to the field of study
-   have analysed the key issues
-   have evaluated arguments
-   have used relevant resources (and a wide range of sources) to effectively support your own arguments or discussion (logical use of evidence)
-   have considered alternative views, theories or evidence
-   have identified potential gaps in knowledge, discussed limitations, and identified further lines of enquiry where appropriate
-   present a logical, well-structured, clear, coherent and persuasive argument (and your writing is in line with academic conventions).

### Applying critical and analytical thinking
1.  **Assess your source(s)**
    What is the source? (e.g. web, academic journal, newspaper etc.)
    What are the strengths and limitations of this source?

2.  **Identify bias**    
    What is the purpose of the writing?
    Does the writing reflect a personal or political viewpoint?
    Who might disagree with the author?
    
3.  **Evaluate the evidence**
    What evidence/examples does the author use?
    How reliable or useful is the evidence?
    Does it support the argument?
    Is the evidence up-to-date?
    
4.  **Consider the argument(s)**
    What is the main argument?
    What statements/evidence in the article strengthen or weaken the argument?
    Are there any assumptions being made?
    Think about the viewpoint in relation to the bigger picture.
    Do other authors share these views? Do their views differ?
    What are the contrasting views?
    
5.  **Draw your conclusions**
    Understand why authors have arrived at different conclusions.
    Argue why one viewpoint is preferable to another.
    All ideas and arguments must be supported by evidence.
    Question your own assumptions and biases as well as those of the author.
